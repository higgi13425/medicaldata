## Indomethacin Pharmacokinetics Dataset Introduction and Description

Source: This data set is from a pharmacokinetic study of oral dosing of the anti-asthma medication, theophylline, in 12 subjects over 25 hours, published By Dr. Robert A. Upton around 1980. The original publication, if any, is unclear and not cited. These data were used in a package named `nlme`, and reported in Boeckmann, A.J., et al. The original publication on theophylline, if any, is unclear and not cited by the package developers. Dr. Upton did publish several papers on theophylline pharmacokinetics around 1980-1984, and these data could have been from one of these.

#### Abstract

 This data set contains data on 12 healthy volunteer subjects who participated in a pharmacokinetic study of oral Theophylline. Theophylline is an anti-asthma medication. It can be administered by the intravenous, oral, or rectal suppository routes. Each subject in this study received a single oral dose of theophylline. Blood samples were taken at frequent intervals over the next 25 hours after dosing, and the quantity of theophylline in the plasma at each time point was measured in micrograms per milliliter.

    <p>This data set was provided through funding from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) as the dataset "diabetes". The donor of dataset to UCI was  Vincent Sigillito of Johns Hopkins.</p>

    <p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with obesity and a diet high in sugars and low in vegetables. People with type 2 DM become less sensitive to insulin, so that after a glucose load, their blood glucose and insulin rise, but the glucose level does not fall as quickly as it should, leading to sustained elevations in glucose and insulin. The incidence of type 2 DM is rising in many western cultures, as increasingly unhealthy and calorie rich diets become common. A version of this dataset is available through the UCI (University of California-Irvine) Machine Learning Repository as "PimaIndiansDiabetes". This dataset was recoded with NA for zero values which were likely to be missing in the variables <code>glucose_mg-dl</code>, <code>insulin_mIU-mL</code>, <code>dbp_mm-hg</code>, <code>triceps_mm</code>, and <code>bmi</code> by Friedrich Leisch. The units of each predictor were added to variable names, and several variables renamed for clarity by Peter Higgins.<br><br>
The primary analysis task is to classify in each participant whether diabetes developed within 5 years of data collection (diabetes_5y = pos), or the participant tested repeatedly negative for diabetes over the next 5 years (diabetes_5y = neg).

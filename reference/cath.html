    <p>Coronary artery disease, or atherosclerosis of the blood vessels supplying the heart, is the most common cause of death in the United States. Duke University Medical Center is located in the southeastern US, in a region of highly prevalent coronary artery disease (CAD), associated with frequent smoking, diabetes, and obesity, along with genetic risk factors for early-onset CAD in the local Lumbee Indian tribe. <br><br>
At catheterization, a reduction in artery diameter by at least 75% is considered a significant reduction in blood flow that puts downstream heart muscle at risk of ischemia. Significant coronary disease can be treated with multiple medications, or by opening the partially blocked artery. This is done with a via a catheter through blood vessels in the wrist or the groin, and threaded through blood vessels to the heart. Once at the location of the blockage, the narrowed area can be opened with a balloon, and the newly opened artery kept open with a carefully placed coronary stent. <br><br>
The <strong>sigdz</strong> variable is an indicator for the presence of a blockage of at least 75% in any one of the left main coronary artery or in any of the three distributing arteries - the LAD, LCA, and RCA.<br><br>
The <strong>tvdlm</strong> variable is an indicator for one of two results from the catheterization. One is three vessel disease - having blockages of all three of the left anterior descendig (LAD) coronary artery, the left circumflex coronary artery (LCA), and the right coronary artery (RCA). This occurs most commonly in association with diabetes, and with longstanding severe CAD. The other is left main disease, which is blockage of the artery that feeds both the LAD and the LCA. Blockage in the left main coronary artery is frequently fatal, and is colloquially known as a "widowmaker". <br><br>
Some interesting potential analyses include predicting the probability of significant (&gt;= 75% diameter narrowing in at least one major coronary artery) coronary disease, and predicting the probability of severe coronary disease given that some significant disease is present. The first analysis would use sigdz as a response variable, and the second would use tvdlm on the subset of patients having sigdz=1. <br><br></p>

    <p>This data set is provided generously by Frank Harrell, from his website <a href="https://hbiostat.org/data/" class="external-link">here</a>, as the dataset "abm". These data were published as <em>Spanos A, Harrell FE, Durack DT (1989): Differential diagnosis of acute meningitis: An analysis of the predictive value of initial observations. JAMA 262: 2700-2707</em>, which can be found <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/379473" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Bacterial meningitis occurs in 1 in 100,000 people per year in the United States, most commonly in people between 16 and 23 years old, with additional age peaks in infants and young children, and the elderly. Early symptoms include headache, fever, and pinprick rash of reddish-purple tiny spots. The peak season for bacterial meningitis is in dry winter months in each hemisphere (December-February in the Northern Hemisphere). Bacterial meningitis has a fatality rate of 15-20%, which is higher in the elderly. Untreated bacterial meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae or H. influenzae approaches 100% mortality. <br><br>
Viral meningitis generally resolves with supportive care, but bacterial meningitis requires early use of antibiotic therapy. A subset of patients will require a head CT (computed tomography) scan before a lumbar puncture to obtain CSF, which must occur before antibiotics are given. The CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) is sent to the lab for cell count and differential, glucose, protein, gram stain, and culture. Normally, the meninges are part of the blood-brain barrier, which keeps assorted toxins we ingest out of the brain. Proteins and large molecules from the bloodstream are not able to reach the CSF normally, and even smaller molecules like glucose equilibrate slowly, so that CSF glucose lags behind changes in blood glucose. Normal CSF has some white blood cells, with around 70% lymphocytes and 30% monocytes, with very few neutrophils. When bacteria begin to multiply in the CSF, CSF protein levels go up, glucose is consumed, and white blood cells (largely neutrophils) arrive to fight the bacteria. Viral infections tend to attract more lymphocytes and monocytes. Characteristic findings in bacterial meningitis include low CSF glucose, a low CSF to serum glucose ratio, high CSF protein, and a high CSF white blood cell count, usually composed of neutrophils. However, the spectrum of CSF values in bacterial meningitis is so wide that any one of these findings is of little value. About 20% of lumbar punctures draw a bit of blood, which is seen when there are more than 100,000 RBCs per cubic mm. This blood will also increase the CSF WBCs by one WBC per every 500-1000 RBCs, and may require adjustment of the WBC number. <br><br>
Empiric treatment with antibiotics is begun as soon as the CSF reaches the lab, often with a combination of ceftriaxone plus vancomycin, and ampicillin is added in the elderly to cover Listeria. Meropenem is often used in the immunocompromised for broader coverage including Listeria and Pseudomonas. The gram stain helps detect bacteria in the CSF, but is only ~60% sensitive, and will usually miss tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, and fungal meningitis. CSF culture (growing the bacteria) is more sensitive, but takes several days.<br><br>
The primary analysis task is to classify viral (abm = 0) vs. bacterial (abm = 1) cases, as published in <em>Spanos A, Harrell FE, Durack DT (1989): Differential diagnosis of acute meningitis: An analysis of the predictive value of initial observations. JAMA 262: 2700-2707.</em> There are data on 581 patients, with typical levels of missing data in clincial observational studies done in the days of paper charts, so you may choose to impute some of the missing data. Some of the variables in the published paper need to be derived, including the CSF to blood glucose ratio, and the number of months from peak of summer (in North Carolina, in the Northern Hemisphere). In addition to imputation, modern machine learning classification techniques can be applied and compared to logistic regression.
